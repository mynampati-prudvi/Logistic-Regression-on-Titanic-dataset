In 1912, the British passenger ship Titanic struck an iceberg, which led to the death of over 1,500 passengers and crew, more than half the people on board.

You want to construct a model with Logistic Regression that uses available data about the passengers to predict their survival.

Use this dataset: titanic_dataset.csv (more information about this dataset is available on Kaggle (Links to an external site.)https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

First, drop columns from the dataset that are obviously unnecessary for your model.
Then, assign the dataset's median Age to rows where the age data is missing.
Then, split the dataset into a training set and test set.
Fit your initial model, and identify and remove from consideration predictors that are not significant.
Plot a ROC curve and find the optimal cutoff probability
Update your predictions using the optimal cutoff
Finally, create a confusion matrix using your final predictions
